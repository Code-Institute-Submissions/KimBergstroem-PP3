## **Program flow**üåé
The flowchart represents the logic of the Bedtime Adventures program. The program starts by prompting the user to input two names and validates the input to ensure that each name is at least three letters long and contains only letters. <br>
![flowchart](/assets/images/flowchart.jpg)

If the input is valid, the program moves on to retrieve the first part of the adventure story from a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. The program replaces placeholders in the story text with the two names inputted by the user and presents the story to the user.

Next, the program prompts the user to make a choice between two options (X or Y) and validates the input to ensure that it is either X or Y. If the input is valid, the program retrieves the corresponding adventure story from the Google Sheet and presents it to the user.

This process repeats for the third part of the adventure story, where the user is prompted to make another choice between X or Y and the input is validated before retrieving and presenting the final part of the story.

Finally, the program displays the ending of the adventure story based on the user's choices throughout the three parts of the story. 

--- 

## **Data model**üåé
The program uses the Google Sheets API to access a Google Sheet that contains the adventure story text. The program then replaces the placeholders for the user names and presents the story to the users. The program uses input() function to get the user's choices and a series of validation functions to ensure that the user inputs are valid.

## **Technologies used**üåé
### **Language**
- Python 3: primary programming language for the project

### **Programs used**
- Lucidchart: an online diagramming tool, was used to create flowcharts for the project
- Gitpod: cloud-based IDE used for version control and writing code
- Git: version control system used for managing and tracking changes to the project's codebase
- GitHub: web-based hosting service used for version control and storing the project's code after being pushed from Gitpod
- Heroku: cloud platform used for deploying and hosting the project's web application

## **Features**üåé
### **Existing features**
This adventure game program prompts users to enter two names and presents them with an adventure story that is divided into three parts. The program checks for errors, such as if the user enters less than three letters or anything other than letters. The error messages are displayed as shown below: <br>
![name_prompt](/assets/images/3letters.png)
![only_letters](/assets/images/onlyletters.png)

The program includes a feature that automatically capitalizes the names entered by the user in the adventure story, even if they are inputted in lowercase letters. This provides a more polished and professional appearance to the output text. <br><br>
At the end of the first part of the story, users are presented with two choices, X or Y. <br>
![choices](/assets/images/xy.png)

Throughout the story, the names that the user entered at the beginning are used.  <br>
![user](/assets/images/user_name_in_story.png)

After the user has made a choice, a confirmation message to reassure that the child made a good choice, is displayed as shown below: <br>
![alt text](/assets/images/choice-confirmation.png)

The second part of the story corresponds to the user's choice. <br>
The third part is the ending of the story, which is also determined by the user's choices in the previous parts.

### **Future ideas**
- More options in story
- More story lines to follow so you begin with picking a story
- Possibility to name the teddy bear after the childs favorite teddy bear.
