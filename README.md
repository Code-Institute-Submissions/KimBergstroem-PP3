## **User story**üåé
As a user who loves to travel and needs to convert currencies, I want to use the Currency Exchanger and Travel Quiz application to easily convert currencies and enjoy an interactive travel-related experience.

--- 

## **How to use Travel Guide**üåé
To get started, simply input the travel destination and also of how much amount of money you will bring with you into the travelling.

## **Program flow**üåé
The flowchart represents the logic of the <b>travel_Guide</b> application. The program starts by prompting the user to input their name and validates the input to ensure that the name is at least three letters long and contains only letters.

If the input is valid, a welcome message is shown briefly and then disappears. 
The terminal is cleared, and the program proceeds to display the main menu, offering four different options. Each option leads to a different path of choice by user:

1. <b>Country:</b>
This path prompts the user with different questions such as "Which content do you want to explore?" and "Which country are you interested in?". The user's inputs are processed using the Google Sheets API. If the inputs are valid string values, the information is saved and compared with existing data in the worksheet. This step ensures the correct currency is displayed for the selected country. The application provides the user with the accurate content, country, and currency information. Once all the necessary information is obtained, the user is prompted to either return to the main menu or perform another country search.

2. <b>Currency code:</b>
Choosing this path displays a library of all current currency codes automatically in the prompt. If the user is unfamiliar with the three-letter currency codes, they can select this option to view the codes. These codes are necessary for the currency exchange feature. After displaying the currency codes, the program automatically returns the user to the main menu.

3. <b>Currency Exchange:</b>
This path enables the user to input a currency and an amount to view the exchange rate. The currency exchange is facilitated by an API connected to the application, specifically the "Fixer API". This API provides daily updated rates between different currencies. The user is also presented with the result of the exchange, and if desired, they can choose to exchange another currency. Otherwise, the program asks whether the user wants to perform another currency exchange or return to the main menu.

4. <b>Exit:</b>
Finally, choosing option 4 displays the concluding message and exits the application. The terminal will be closed.

## **Data model**üåé
The program uses the <b>Google Sheets API</b> to access a Google Sheet that contains the content, country and currency data. The program then saves and compare the placeholders for the user inputs and presents the result information. The program uses input() function to get the user's choices and a series of validation functions to ensure that the user inputs are valid.

The <b>Fixer API</b> is utilized in this application to provide access to real-time and historical exchange rate data for currency conversion purposes. It enables the integration of currency exchange functionality.

Also, import <b>sys, time, os, requests, gspread</b> in this application. 
By importing these libraries and modules into the project, I gain access to their respective functionalities and can utilize them for various tasks, such as system interactions, time-related operations, HTTP requests, and Google Sheets integration.

## **Technologies used**üåé
### **Language**
- <b>Python 3</b>: primary programming language for the project
- <b>Html</b>, <b>css</b> and <b>javascript</b> is also used but only manipulated for better UI experience for user.

### **Programs used**
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) an online diagramming tool, was used to create flowcharts for the project
- [Gitpd](https://gitpod.io/) cloud-based IDE used for version control and writing code

## **Features**üåé
### **Existing features**
This adventure game program prompts users to enter two names and presents them with an adventure story that is divided into three parts. The program checks for errors, such as if the user enters less than three letters or anything other than letters. The error messages are displayed as shown below: <br>
![name_prompt](/assets/images/3letters.png)
![only_letters](/assets/images/onlyletters.png)

The program includes a feature that automatically capitalizes the names entered by the user in the adventure story, even if they are inputted in lowercase letters. This provides a more polished and professional appearance to the output text. <br><br>
At the end of the first part of the story, users are presented with two choices, X or Y. <br>
![choices](/assets/images/xy.png)

Throughout the story, the names that the user entered at the beginning are used.  <br>
![user](/assets/images/user_name_in_story.png)

After the user has made a choice, a confirmation message to reassure that the child made a good choice, is displayed as shown below: <br>
![alt text](/assets/images/choice-confirmation.png)

The second part of the story corresponds to the user's choice. <br>
The third part is the ending of the story, which is also determined by the user's choices in the previous parts.

### **Future ideas**
- More options in story
- More story lines to follow so you begin with picking a story
- Possibility to name the teddy bear after the childs favorite teddy bear.

## **Validation**üåé
All string validation have the "<b>.capitalize()</b>" function to prevent any big or small letter errors.

### **Name validation:**
- 3 or more letters inserted - OK for user name
- Only letters - OK for user name
- Correct name input - OK for user name
- Numbers instead of letters A-Z - OK, gives correct error message
- 2 lettters inserted - OK, gives correct error message

### **Main Meny validation:**
- Chocing 1-4 number: - OK, Takes user to the option entered
- Trying another number besides the "1-4" - OK, gives correct error message
- Trying to insert a string instead - OK, gives the correct error message
- Anything else inserted - OK, gives the correct error message

### **Currency code validation:**
- If putting the 3 letter code - OK, gives the user the option to exchange the currency and know that this currency code exist
- If putting interger instead of string value - OK, gives the correct error message
- If putting wrong 3 letters code - OK, gives the correct error message displaying that this code is not an existing currency code
- Anything else inserted - OK, gives the correct error message
