## **How to use Travel Guide**üåé
The app will instantly display the converted amount based on current exchange rates. In addition to currency conversion, the app offers engaging travel-related questions to make your experience enjoyable. Explore destination recommendations, travel tips, for your trip planning. Enjoy the convenience of currency conversion and the excitement of discovering new travel insights with the travel_Guide app.

--- 

## **Program flow**üåé
The flowchart represents the logic of the <b>travel_Guide</b> application. The program starts by prompting the user to input their name and validates the input to ensure that the name is at least three letters long and contains only letters.

If the input is valid, a welcome message is shown briefly and then disappears. 
The terminal is cleared, and the program proceeds to display the main menu, offering four different options. Each option leads to a different path of choice by user:

1. <b>Country:</b>
This path prompts the user with different questions such as "Which content do you want to explore?" and "Which country are you interested in?". The user's inputs are processed using the Google Sheets API. If the inputs are valid string values, the information is saved and compared with existing data in the worksheet. This step ensures the correct currency is displayed for the selected country. The application provides the user with the accurate content, country, and currency information. Once all the necessary information is obtained, the user is prompted to either return to the main menu or perform another country search.

2. <b>Currency code:</b>
Choosing this path displays a library of all current currency codes automatically in the prompt. If the user is unfamiliar with the three-letter currency codes, they can select this option to view the codes. These codes are necessary for the currency exchange feature. After displaying the currency codes, the program automatically returns the user to the main menu.

3. <b>Currency Exchange:</b>
This path enables the user to input a currency and an amount to view the exchange rate. The currency exchange is facilitated by an API connected to the application, specifically the "Fixer API". This API provides daily updated rates between different currencies. The user is also presented with the result of the exchange, and if desired, they can choose to exchange another currency. Otherwise, the program asks whether the user wants to perform another currency exchange or return to the main menu.

4. <b>Exit:</b>
Finally, choosing option 4 displays the concluding message and exits the application. The terminal will be closed.

## **Data model**üåé
The program uses the <b>Google Sheets API</b> to access a Google Sheet that contains the content, country and currency data. The program then saves and compare the placeholders for the user inputs and presents the result information. The program uses input() function to get the user's choices and a series of validation functions to ensure that the user inputs are valid.

The <b>Fixer API</b> is utilized in this application to provide access to real-time and historical exchange rate data for currency conversion purposes. It enables the integration of currency exchange functionality.

Also, import <b>sys, time, os, requests, gspread</b> in this application. 
By importing these libraries and modules into the project, I gain access to their respective functionalities and can utilize them for various tasks, such as system interactions, time-related operations, HTTP requests, and Google Sheets integration.
